## Program 1 : program1.c
- count no of characters, white spaces and vowels in a input line

## Program 2 : program2.c
- read a file and count no of characters, no of words and no of lines in the file.
NOTE : Ensure that you have a file named 'text.txt' before executing

## Program 3 : program3.c
- find words that contain at least a vowel from a file and store it in a table and then find the no. of occurances that particular word in the file by taking word from the table.
NOTE : Ensure that you have a file named 'test1.txt' before executing

## Program 4 : program4.c
- construct a finite automata which will identify the keywords like : if, for, while, do, else and identifiers from a file
NOTE : Ensure that you have a file named 'test2.txt' before executing which consists a C program

## Program 5 : program5.c
- generate a symbol table from an assembly language program stored in a file
NOTE : Ensure that you have a file named 'ass1.txt' before executing which consists a C program
